# Tastr
Team Project for CS4444: Software Engineering

## Tastr is an Android App that allows users to decide what they want to eat instead of where.
Have you ever been to a new Restaraunt that looked great in your head, but once you got there their menu didn't have anything you would want? Then Tastr is for you.
